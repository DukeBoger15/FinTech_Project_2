<h1>Machine Learning Trading Bot Project</h1>
This repo contains the code for my FinTech Bootcamp Project 2
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<li>I am assuming the role of a market analyst tasked with researching algorithmic trading models to assist with our firm day trading and eliminating errors in trade order entry. We have used a manual trading method for all of our trading throughout the firms history and we want to explore ways to create chances for our clients to take advantage.</li>
<h2>What I am Creating</h2>
<li>I am creating a machine learning algorthimic trading model. This model uses machine learning to train and test the data imported from Yahoo Finance, assign Signals for when to enter the market (buy) or when to exit the market(sell). Then the model uses machine learning to train and generate trade predictions using training signals. This data is then presented in a classification report providing us with precision, recall and accuracy data from the machine learning model. After training the model, we then will backtest the algorithm against the machine learning model. </li>
<h3>Libraries and Technologies Used</h3>
<li>Pandas, numpy, hvplot, matplotlib, scikit-learn, imblearn and RandomOverSampler, Google Colab, yfinance, and finta</li>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<li> In your browser, search for Google Colab or follow this link https://colab.research.google.com/ </li>
<li> Once you access Google Colab, to open the file from GitHub, go to File, Upload Notebook, then select GitHub amongst the options at the top of the screen, Search for my GitHub Username and Deploy the DukeBoger15/FinTEch_Project_2 repo. A picture is provided below to ensure you are opening the correct notebook to Goole Colab.</li>
